The submitted code includes 7 classes Book, Main, Reader, Tag, Crypto, ReaderGUI and Utils. The code was compiled and developed on Eclipse using the Java JDK 7. We did not use external libraries that require including the .jar files.

To compile the program we suggest that you use the Eclipse IDE. There are two main ways to include the code in Eclipse and get it to run.
i)  Make a new Java project in eclipse. Copy or move the submitted -java files to the src in the project directory. Refresh the package explorer in Eclipse and the files should be included in the project, and can now be run.
ii) Create a new Java project by importing a "File system". Select the directory that holds the submitted .java files. When the project is created, the program should be able to compile and run.

The program can be run using the submitted .jar file. This .jar file is executable and can be run either by double clicking on its icon, or by using the following command in a Linux terminal:

java -jar rfid.jar
